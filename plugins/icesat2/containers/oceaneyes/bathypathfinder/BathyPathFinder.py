    The Sea Surface/Bathymetry Photon Classifier by RANSAC/A*
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    
    tau (float) :: The RANSAC residual distance. This can be thought 
                   of as the sea surface thickness, or approximately
                   half the wave height. 
                  (default=0.5)
                   
    k (int)     :: The number of neighbors in the BallTree subprocess.
                   This controls the connectedness of the bathymetry.
                   Values between 10-20 are recommended. 
                   (default=15)
                   
    n (int)     :: The percentile for edge pruning. Must be between 
                   0-100. Smaller values for n will remove more 
                   edges. Values between 95-99 are recommended.
