# SlideRule ICESat-2 Plugin
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/344240956.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/344240956)

This SlideRule plugin includes algorithms for processing ICESat-2 data products.

If you are a science user interested in processing ICESat-2 data with SlideRule, please see the [sliderule-python examples](https://github.com/SlideRuleEarth/sliderule-python) or our [documentation](https://slideruleearth.io) for help getting started.

## I. Prerequisites

The base build environment must be setup as described in the [SlideRule](https://github.com/SlideRuleEarth/sliderule) readme.  Follow the first three steps in the Quick Start section to install the necessary system packages.  See [SlideRule Readme: III. Quick Start](https://github.com/SlideRuleEarth/sliderule/blob/master/README.md#iii-quick-start).


## II. Building

Use the [Makefile](Makefile) to build and install the plugin.

For a development version of SlideRule that supports the plugin and is run locally, first build and install the sliderule server application:
```bash
$ make config
$ make
$ make install
```

Then build and install the ICESat-2 plugin:
```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake <path_to_sliderule_repo>/plugins/icesat2 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ make
$ make install
```

## III. What Is Provided

The plugin supplies the following endpoints:
* [atl06](endpoints/atl06.lua): process a single granule of ATL03 photon data segments to produce elevations
* [atl06p](endpoints/atl06p.lua): parallel process ATL03 photon data segments to produce geolocated elevations
* [atl03s](endpoints/atl03s.lua): create and return ATL03 photon data segments from a single granule
* [atl03sp](endpoints/atl03sp.lua): create and return ATL03 photon data segments in parallel
* [atl06](endpoints/atl08.lua): process a single granule of ATL03 photon data segments to produce vegetation metrics
* [atl06p](endpoints/atl08p.lua): parallel process ATL03 photon data segments to produce geolocated vegetation metrics
* [indexer](endpoints/idnexer.lua): process ATL03 resource and produce an index record (used with [build_indexes.py](utils/build_indexes.py))

This plugin supplies the following record types:
* `atl03rec`: a variable along-track extent of ATL03 photon data
* `atl03rec.photons`: individual ATL03 photons
* `atl06rec`: ATL06 algorithm results
* `atl06rec.elevation`: individual ATL06 elevations
* `atl03rec.index`: phoreal algorithm results
* `atl08rec`: a variable along-track extent of vegatation metrics
* `atl08rec.vegatation`: vegatation metrics
* `waverec`: return waveform built from ATL03 photons

The plugin supplies the following lua user data types:
* `icesat2.atl03s(<url>, <outq_name>, [<parms>])`: ATL03 reader base object
* `icesat2.atl03indexer(<asset>, <resource table>, <outq_name>, [<num threads>])`: ATL03 indexer base object
* `icesat2.atl06(<outq name>)`: ATL06 dispatch object
* `icesat2.atl08(<outq name>)`: ATL08 dispatch object
* `icesat2.ut_atl03()`: ATL03 reader unit test base object
* `icesat2.ut_atl06()`: ATL06 dispatch unit test base object
