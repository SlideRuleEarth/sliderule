# Ignore PDAL PoissonFilter static strdup leak
#
# The leak originates inside PDAL's bundled Poisson surface reconstruction support, specifically in vendor/kazhdan/Ply.h,
# where the static face_props array initializes its name field by calling _strdup("vertex_indices") during module registration.
# Because that memory is never freed, AddressSanitizer flags it as a 15-byte leak when the process exits under ASAN.
# It is a one-time allocation that never grows and lives for the lifetime of the executable.
