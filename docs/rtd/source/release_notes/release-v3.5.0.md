# Release v3.5.0

2023-06-09

Version description of the v3.5.0 release of ICESat-2 SlideRule.  This document also captures functionality added in versions v3.4.0 and v3.4.1.

## Major Changes

* __3DEP Plugin [Feature Preview]__: Support for sampling the 3DEP 1m DEM rasters has been added, along with an update to the Python client to query the USGS TNM catalog.  See examples in the sliderule-python repo for more details at this time.

* __Node.js Client [Feature Preview]__: The SlideRule team is now supporting a client in a second language: javascript.  This will ultimately support a future web-client development.  The current client only supports generic requests and returns data as a list of objects.

* __SWOT Plugin [Feature Preview]__: Support added for subsetting the simulated L2 datasets provided by the SWOT project to the PODAAC.  A `swot.py` module in the Python client has also been added.

## Development Updates

* Added new pytests for performance monitoring, strip sampling, and file_directory. Also reorganized the pytests to better reflect their functionality; [233](https://github.com/ICESat2-SlideRule/sliderule/issues/233), [235](https://github.com/ICESat2-SlideRule/sliderule/issues/235), [246](https://github.com/ICESat2-SlideRule/sliderule/issues/246).

* Broadened support for netCDF in H5Coro by adding code to handle different superblock versions, filter message versions, and fill data message versions.  Work was performed in support of SWOT plugin.

## Issues Resolved

* Changed the default CRS for data generated by SlideRule to EPSG:7912 (it was EPSG:4320 before).

* The 3DEP plugin code overrides the target raster's CRS. Code uses the UTM zone value from raster and calculates a new target CRS from the zone.

* The PGC plugin uses custom wkt2 files to define the target CRS for ArcticDEM and REMA. The CRSes supplied by the PGC rasters are ignored.

* For both the 3DEP and PGC plugins the transform generates a vertical shift that is added to the value read from the raster if the value represents an elevation.

* When sampling a raster returns a "nodata" value, that value is replaced with NaN and returned to the user.  We do this because we do not include the "nodata" value back to the user for them to be able to recognized which values are empty.
