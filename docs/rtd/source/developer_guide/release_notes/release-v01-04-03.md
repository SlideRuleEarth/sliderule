# Release v1.4.3

2022-05-31

Version description of the v1.4.3 release of ICESat-2 SlideRule.

## New Features

## Major Issues Resolved

- Updated YAPC algorithm to Jeff's latest specification (05-23-22): version 3.0.  The new algorithm is the default version that runs.  If the previous algorithm is desired, there is a `version` parameter which is a part of the `yapc` parameter block that can be set to "1", and the original algorithm will execute.  Note: the new algorithm runs about three times faster than the original one.

- Fixed calculation of the segment id.  There was a rounding error on the server side and a parsing error on the construction of the dataframe in the client.
