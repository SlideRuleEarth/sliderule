# Release v1.2.0

2021-11-17

Version description of the v1.2.0 release of ICESat-2 SlideRule.

***Important***: Consul service discovery replaced by internal solution which is now accessed via a different port (8050 instead of 8500).  This breaks backward compatibility of the Python client, so the client needs to be updated to use this latest release.

## New Features

* The along track distance from the equator of each elevation and each photon has been added to their respective record definitions.  For the **atl03** API's the field name is `segment_dist`; for the **atl06** API's the field name is `distance`.

* The **atl03** and **atl06** API's now support specifying the `len` (extent length) and `res` (extent resolution) parameters in terms of whole ATL03 segments.  This is achieved by setting the `dist_in_seg` field in the request parameters to true.

* Added `post` function to the **netsvc** package Lua function calls.

## Major Issues Resolved
