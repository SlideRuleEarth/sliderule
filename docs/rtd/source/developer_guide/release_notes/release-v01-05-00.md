# Release v1.5.x

2023-01-11

Version description of the v1.5.x set of releases of ICESat-2 SlideRule.  This series of releases represent a set of beta builds for the upcoming v2.0.0 release and often include incomplete and unstable functionality.  The last stable release prior to the v1.5.x series is v1.4.6.  The next stable release will be v2.0.0, which will not be backward compatible with the v1.4.6 release and will require users to update their Python client.

## New Features

The SlideRule system underwent a gradual architectural shift from a single public cluster, to a set of provisioned clusters that can be either public or private.  Supporting private clusters entail authentication, encrypted http traffic (i.e. https), and a provisioning system that deploys/destroys and monitors each cluster.
