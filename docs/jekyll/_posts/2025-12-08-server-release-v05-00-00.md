### TL;DR

* There are breaking changes (which will hopefully be minimal because they involved features that have been deprecated for some time)
* ATL24 release 002 is now the default
* The internal Asset Metadata Service is used for: ATL24, ATL13, and 3DEP (only when specified)
* Earthdata error reporting should be more intuitive
* `h5p` supports slices
